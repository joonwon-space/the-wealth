## Current work

### Milestone 11-5: TanStack Query Adoption (P1)
Replace manual Axios + useState data fetching with TanStack Query for cache consistency and deduplication.

- [x] Install `@tanstack/react-query` + `@tanstack/react-query-devtools`; add `QueryClientProvider` to `app/layout.tsx`
- [x] Migrate dashboard page (`/dashboard`) to use `useQuery` with `refetchInterval: 30_000`; keep SSE price update via `queryClient.setQueryData`
- [ ] Migrate portfolios list page (`/dashboard/portfolios`) to use `useQuery`; use `useMutation` + `invalidateQueries` for create/rename/delete
- [ ] Migrate portfolio detail page (`/dashboard/portfolios/[id]`) holdings and transactions to `useQuery`/`useMutation`
- [ ] Add unified skeleton loading states and standardized error UI components using TanStack Query `isLoading`/`isError` states

### Milestone 13-5b: Data Integrity (P2)
- [ ] Add holdings quantity reconciliation endpoint `GET /health/holdings-reconciliation` — detect mismatch between transaction sum and current holdings quantity

### Milestone 13-5a: Operational Stability (P2)
- [ ] Add Redis failure fallback — wrap Redis calls in `try/except`; fall back to in-memory dict cache with warning log when Redis is unavailable
