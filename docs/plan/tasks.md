## Current work

### Milestone 11-7: Frontend Quality (P2)

- [x] Add ▲/▼ directional icons to PnLBadge for gain/loss (accessibility non-color indicators)
- [x] Wrap each dashboard widget (summary cards, allocation chart, holdings table) in granular ErrorBoundary so one widget failure doesn't crash the whole page
- [ ] Add SSE connection status indicator to dashboard — show "실시간" badge when connected, "연결 끊김" + reconnect button when disconnected
- [ ] Add `@next/bundle-analyzer` script to frontend package.json (`analyze` script using `ANALYZE=true npm run build`)

### Milestone 13-5a: Operational Stability — Scheduler Alerting (P2)

- [ ] Track consecutive scheduler failures in `sync_logs` — add `consecutive_failures` counter and log CRITICAL when `kis_sync` or `daily_close_snapshot` fails 3+ times in a row

### Milestone 13-5b: Data Integrity — Orphan Cleanup (P2)

- [ ] Add `GET /health/orphan-records` endpoint — detect holdings/transactions/watchlist items referencing deleted portfolios; return counts per table

### Milestone 13-5c: KIS API Health Check (P2)

- [ ] Add KIS API health check on startup — attempt a test price fetch; log WARNING and set a `KIS_AVAILABLE` flag; price endpoints return cached data when flag is False
